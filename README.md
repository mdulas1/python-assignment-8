# 🐍 Python OOP Practice Tasks

This repository contains **beginner to intermediate Python tasks** designed to help learners understand **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as:

* ✅ Creating and using **classes**
* ✅ Defining **attributes** and **methods**
* ✅ Using **constructors (`__init__`)**
* ✅ Working with **objects (instances)**
* ✅ Encapsulation (storing and managing data inside objects)

Each task is designed to be **real-life relatable** so learners can understand **why and how OOP is useful** in solving practical problems.
